# <Updated Portfolio>

## Description

In this assignment, I updated my portfolio using React. Using React, my portfolio now looks cleaner, more professional and modern. Using React, I was able to separate the diffent sections of the website into reusable sections like the header and footer, while only modifying the content in the being displayed depending on which section was being viewed.
