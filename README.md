# <Updated Portfolio>

## Description

In this assignment, I updated my portfolio using React. Using React, my portfolio now looks cleaner, more professional and modern. With React, I was able to separate the different sections of the website into reusable sections like the header and footer, which won't need to change from section to section. I therefore only was modifying the content in the body.
